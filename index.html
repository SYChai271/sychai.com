                My passion for programming and creating useful tools prompted me to join the
                <span>Robotics Club CCA</span> in secondary school. There, I was able to develop
                this interest and take up various leadership positions, most notably,
                <span>CCA Vice-Chairperson</span>. In JC, I continued to hone my skills in
                programming and engineering, joining the
                <span>Engineering & Tech Programme Scholarship</span> as well as becoming
                <span>Vice-President of my STEM CCA</span>. I also took part in the
                <span>Nanyang Research Programme</span>, where I utlised ML to model plant growth
                based on environemntal data collected by IoT sensors. My interest in Competitive
                Robotics continued, allowing me to clinch a second national title in Robotics and
                even <span>represent Singapore at the International Final in TÃ¼rkiye</span>.

                      Chess is one of my favourite passtimes as it helps me develop my problem
                      solving abilities as well as my critical thinking. This is why I decided that
                      I wanted to make a replica of the board game from scratch using python. This
                      was my first big project that I endeavoured on at that point in time so the
                      prospect of building the entire app ground up seemed overwhelming to me
                      initially. Indeed, it was no easy task and my abilities were pushed to their
                      limit in order for me to figure out solutions to all sorts of bugs that had
                      arised along the way. In hindsight, there were certain aspects of my code that
                      could receive some cleaning up as well as a few bugs that needed to be taken
                      care of, but for the most part, the game is functional and I was glad that I
                      did not give up midway as this journey has been very rewarding and fruitful.

                      This was my first web developemnet project after learning the fundamentals.
                      This website was designed to showcase my groups's research and ideas for the
                      23rd Elementz Science Research Conference & Exhibition. In this project, I
                      applied many concepts which I had learnt such as building a responsive layout
                      using bootstrap, as well as learning how to style images via CSS. This
                      experience has been very fulfilling as I was able to upgrade my web
                      development skills while at the same time playing my part for the team.

                      Due to the pandemic, I was unable to compete in any robotics competition in
                      2020, which makes this the first robotics competition I took part in. Although
                      I had received training and had attempted numerous practices, none of which
                      was able to be compared with the scale and difficulty of the WRO missions.
                      Needless to say, I had made uncountable mistakes during the preparation for
                      this competition mainly due to my inexperience. For instance, rather than
                      taking my time and brainstorming plausible solutions, I jumped straight into
                      it with my initial idea which I was optimistic about, but after several weeks
                      of testing, I realised that my prototype was not going to cut it. It was
                      difficult to go back to square one and start over but I understood that it was
                      necessary in order for me to have any hopes of improving. This competition
                      taught me the importance of perserverance; to have the urge to continue
                      despite mutliple setbacks which I had faced when the robot was performing
                      inconsistently. It was only after countless hours of hardwork did I managed to
                      overcome these difficulties. In terms of skills, I learnt many new algorithms
                      like PID line tracing, various search and sort algorithms and even implemented
                      depth first search to find the shortest path.

                      This was another website that I made to showcase our teams proposal for a
                      platform to encourage citizens to indulge in home gardening, in hopes of
                      attaining the 30by30 goal. Similar to the Avis Fashion website, this was also
                      made using bootstrap and vanilla CSS. Additionally, I was able to include some
                      javascript which I had learnt along the way to enhance the user experience of
                      the website. This continued my interest for building websites and prompted me
                      to learn more about back-end web development.

                      The 2022 mission was radically different from that of 2021. There were many
                      more elements demanding greater expertise in the engineering of robot to
                      enable to it cross obstacles and perform precise actions. Compared to the
                      previous year, the tasks this year were more challenging in terms of building.
                      Upon realising this, I could not help but feel slightly nervous as my building
                      was not as well-rounded as my programming. Nonetheless, I felt that this was a
                      good opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and try out something new and
                      build innovative mechanisms and experiment with different robot bases.
                      Designing a good robot is a multifaceted process that requires understanding
                      in various physics topics such as centre of gravity as well as the principles
                      of moments to enable the robot to perform the tasks with ease, which I felt
                      that I had accomplished. In terms of programming, I was able to design an
                      algorithm to allow the robot to sense objects accurately while moving at high
                      speeds to save time. This led me employ statstics functions like mean and
                      median as well as standard deviation to calculate the optimal sensor reading
                      for evaluation to yield the most reliable results. Furthermore, there were
                      other creative ideas I tried such as using the PID algorithm to control the
                      distance of the robot from the wall rather than for line tracing as there was
                      a lack of lines on the playing field. This method turned out to be very
                      feasible as it was efficacious in maintaining the consistency and positioning
                      of the robot.
